### Connecting to the server
Go to the web address assigned to your account. It should be your api-tenant followed by boonlogic.com. For example: https://6d4ed33b636a961b.boonlogic.com. This link can be found in the .BoonLogic file which was included in the account generation.

On the righthand side about halfway down, click on the `Authenticate` button and enter in the api-key associated with your account.
