# Tutorial: Getting Started

### Open Nano UI
1. Go to the web address assigned to your account. It should be your api-tenant followed by boonlogic.com. For example: https://6d4ed33b636a961b.boonlogic.com/index.html?api-tenant=130778449cb1588d. This link can be found in the welcome email.

2. There should be a title that says: `Boon Logic BoonNano API`

### Authenticate
1. Copy your unique api-key associated with your account from the .BoonLogic file.
2. In the nano web page, on the right side after the title panel, click on the blue button labeled `Authorize` with a lock
3. When prompted, enter the copied api-key in the `Value` field
4. Click `Authorize`
5. Close the prompt window

Congratulations! Your nano web access is now ready to use.
